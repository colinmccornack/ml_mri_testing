MRI ML Testing
The goal of this was to become familiar with OOP/python through an applied example of making a generalized transfer-learning workflow to apply existing CNN models to MRI image classification. I used two datasets for this, the first a collection of brain tumor MRIs to classify the malignancy, and the second a collection of Alzheimer's MRIs to classify disease severity. In exploring this, I quickly got lost in the weeds due to the complexity and diversity of approaches you can use to solve this classification problem and the current state of the field. In the end, I chose to ignore these, as the goal wasn't to make the most groundbreaking/novel approach to this problem (something I'm ill-equipped to do) but to learn how to work through it and structure code to do this using existing methods.
